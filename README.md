# Blog

Simple multi-page blog. Same design as before, just with an index page.

## How to add a new post

1. **Copy `post1.html`** and rename it (e.g., `post2.html`)

2. **Edit the new file:**
   - Change the `<title>` at the top
   - Change the `<h1>` (main title)
   - Change the `<h2>` (your name)
   - Change the `<h3>` (date)
   - Replace the content

3. **Update `index.html`:**
   - Copy the post link block
   - Update `href="post2.html"`
   - Update the title and date
   - Increase the animation delay (0.2s, 0.3s, etc.)

That's it!
