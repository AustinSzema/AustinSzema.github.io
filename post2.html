    <h1>What Expedition 33 Means for the Game Industry</h1>
    <h2>Austin Szema</h2>
    <h3>2/5/26</h3>
    
    Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 swept the game awards this year, sparking lots of debate online for several different reasons. Many people called into question the game being defined as an “indie game”, as its graphical fidelity and financial backing puts it more in the category of a AA game, not an indie game. I think the most interesting thing about this game is not the game itself, but the story behind the studio, and what it means for the future of the industry. Sandfall Interactive was founded by an ex-Ubisoft developer who grew frustrated with the lack of creative freedom that comes with AAA development. The core team consists of roughly 33 game industry veterans who came from primarily AAA backgrounds with a lot of them being ex-Ubisoft, however the team also outsourced lots of the work to external contractors, a large part of why many people questioned the game’s “indie” nature. 
    <br><br>
    The narrative that has been perpetuated around this studio “33 ex-Ubisoft devs founded a studio and made game of the year”, while not entirely accurate, tells a broader story about the current state of the industry. Developers are increasingly becoming frustrated with the creative restrictions and lack of innovation that many AAA companies face due to their financial and organizational structures, with many developers waiting to see which of their colleagues will be the first to make the jump to indie. With the release and critical acclaim of Expedition 33, a signal flare has been sent out to the industry that times are changing. You no longer need a massive corporation in order to make a high fidelity, financially successful, and critically acclaimed game. If a group of ex-AAA developers with the help of outsourced external developers can make Game of the Year with their very first release, then so can others. I anticipate that within the next 5-10 years, we will start to see a massive shift in the industry, as experienced developers depart from their AAA studios, taking their friends with them, and starting their own studios with the help of outsourcing to make the next Game of the Year. Part of this shift comes with the fact that you no longer need to be “a tiny indie game”. The jump doesn’t have to be so drastic that you go from a AAA studio to a fully “indie” studio, you can go from AAA to AA, using the financial backings of your industry connections to support development, with your investors knowing that your team has the experience and technical ability to deliver a successful product.
    <br><br>
    We have reached a point in the games industry where some of the earliest pioneers of the industry have ascended to senior director roles. We have entered into a period where the industry has become saturated with tons of well seasoned developers who may be looking for new opportunities. We are also the first wave of industry veterans who will be retiring soon. Many people fail to realize how new the game industry is, with it having started around the 1970s, it is now beginning to mature and see its first wave of original developers start to retire. Many of the legends of industry are around the ages of 50-70 (Todd Howard, John Carmac, and Masahiro Sakurai are all 55 as of today 2/5/26) and as they approach retirement age, we will begin to see a huge shift in the industry, as this will be the first time that these long-standing names will no longer be active in the space, leaving opportunity for new legends to be made. On the CMU ETC west coast trip this year, we visited many studios in LA and SF, and a common thread amongst many of these up and coming studios was the same story: a group of ex-AAA developers started a studio and are working on the next big franchises. These studios share many familiarities with Sandfall Interactive, AAA background, not quite indie but not AAA, and tapping into the ideas of their seasoned veteran leaders, with total creative freedom. 
    <br><br>
    Most of these studios are only hiring Senior talent as of right now, but as they grow, the need to hire new talent to keep their companies sustained will arise, which bodes positively for the thousands of students looking to break into the industry in the next generation.
    <br><br>

    <!-- Some of the best game designers have historically been people who are not formally trained as game designers, rather they are programmers, artists, sound designers, or specialists in a very specific creative discipline that want to apply that discipline towards making a game. With that, what happens when someone's specialization is "game design"? What does it mean for a "game designer" to design a game, compared to an artist making a game? The notion of a "game designer", someone who is specifically trained in the field of game design, is a fairly new concept.  Pong came out in 1972, with the first game design degrees showing up around the early 2000s with Champlain College, USC, NYU, DigiPen, and CMU. Many of these programs also specifically train game design as an aspect of computer science, often falling under the title of "game development", not strictly "game design". Now in 2026, there are hundreds of programs with game design degrees in the US alone. 
    <br><br>
    We are entering into a generation in which the next batch of industry leading game designers are people who have been taught specifically to be "game designers". So what does this mean for the industry as a whole? Certainly the barrier to entry has been raised. Recruiters are now specifically targeting students who have majored in game design related programs and who have experience working on games through school projects and game jams. There's also the question of whether or not someone who has a background as a "game designer" will make better games than for example someone with a background as an artist. What often makes games made by people who have not been formally trained in game design is that they bring a unique perspective that designers wouldn't necessarily consider when ideating. Programs such as NYU's Game Center specifically look for people that are artists, sound designers, and other creatives, and train them to apply their unique backgrounds towards making games. So the question arises of "should we even teach game design?" and "what does it mean for someone to be a "game designer?" Is it better for people looking to make great games to train themselves in a related field and then apply those skills to making games? Is it harder for "pure game designers" to make great games? Or is it simply that they need to draw upon other aspects of their lives that they have specialties and experience in? Also what does it mean to have a "game design degree"? When someone has a degree in art, we have a relatively clear idea of what that person does. When someone has a degree in computer science, we have a relatively clear idea of that person's skillset. But tell anyone that you have a "game design degree" and they'll likely think "ok so you just play video games" or "oh so it's like esports"
    <br><br>
    While in the past you could get into the games industry with nothing more than a single game jam project and a tic tac toe program written in Java, the expectations have exponentially skyrocketed for applications, and I predict that we will see a large shift in the industry, where the majority of senior developers will have come from top game design schools, rather than having pivoted from other industries or disciplines.
    <br><br>
    As someone with a BFA in Game Design from Northeastern University, it is something that I have been pondering over for a while, and in time I'm sure my thoughts will evolve as the industry shifts. One thing I do know for certain though, is that the craft of game design is definitely becoming more respected in the general public.
